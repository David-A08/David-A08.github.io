### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was a favorite because it was the first time I was able to make a game in C++. It was only our third lab so I didnâ€™t have that much experience with C++ yet but it was still fun and easy to create. Another reason why Lab 3 was a favorite is because the Hi-Lo game is a two player game which allowed me to play it with my friend after we were done coding.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because like Lab 3, it also was about the Hi-Lo game, I was excited to work again on the code I wrote before and now with more knowledge make improvements. This time I was able to use loops in the code and the program returned a warmer or colder message depending on how close the guess is. I was able to turn the Hi-Lo game from Lab 3 into a new and improved version of itself.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because I coded a program that was able to find the difference between two dates. I personally use date difference calculators online frequently to figure out how long its been since a certain event. So being able to make one was very interesting to me, and we also were able to use the Fliegel & Van Flandern algorithm from Lab 04 again.
